# Computational Physics

Here is a collection of things I have coded up across a wide range of physics topics

- `1_dc_squid_numerical` Numerically solve the dc-SQUID equations of motion using the Runge-Kutta 4(5) method 
- `2_hydrogen_atom` Plot the energy-eigenfunctions of the hydrogen atom using two methods: 1) direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian using the finite-difference method and 2) using the analytical formula
- `3_ising_model` Simulate the 2D Ising model using Monte Carlo simulation and the Metropolis algorithm. Implemented from Schroeder _Introduction to Thermal Physics_ section 8.2
